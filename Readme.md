# All in One Hub

## Project Description

The **All in One Hub** is a web-based storefront that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their cart by increasing, decreasing, or deleting items. Users can also search for specific products by name. The products are fetched from the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/), and the cart's state is dynamically updated and displayed on the page.

---

## File Structure

The project is divided into three main folders: `html`, `css`, and `js`. Each folder contains the respective files for the structure, style, and logic of the webpage.

### File Organization
